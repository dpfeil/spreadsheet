# Minimal Spreadsheet

### Technical Requirements

- TypeScript
- CSS Grid

We would like to learn more about your approach to solving tasks related to Sites by using similar technologies to ours.

Using as vanilla as approach you're comfortable with, create a web app with a usable spreadsheet. Please spend no more than four hours on this task.


### Features

- Arithmetic in cells
- Referencing cells values (e.g. `"=A1 + B2"`)
- Adding additional rows
- Adding additional columns

I believe omitting a library such as React may make this task simpler, but please choose your most comfortable toolset!


### Bonus Features

Entirely optional. Please only complete these if you have additional time:
- Persisting cell values between refreshes
- Reorderable rows
- Reorderable columns
